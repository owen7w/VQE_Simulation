# 🧪 VQE Molecular Simulation – H₂ (Work in Progress)

This is a work-in-progress project for our **Quantum Computing class**. We're using **PennyLane** to simulate the hydrogen molecule (H₂) and estimate its **ground state energy** using the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**.

## Purpose

To explore how quantum simulation can be used in **drug discovery** by finding stable molecules based on their quantum energy.

## 🛠️ How to Run

I am using python 3.9.13

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python h2_vqe_example.py
